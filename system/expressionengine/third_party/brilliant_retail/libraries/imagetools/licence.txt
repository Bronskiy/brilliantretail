EXTENDED LICENSE

The Extended License grants you, the Purchaser, a non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to make use of the work you acquire (Work).

Your use of the Work, under the Extended License, is subject to the following conditions:

Your use of the Work is limited to a single application.

You may use the Work alone or you may incorporate the Work into another work you are creating.

Unless you have our prior written consent, you must not directly or indirectly license, sub-license, sell or resell or provide for free the Work or offer to do any of these things unless the Work is incorporated into a work you have created. All of these things are referred to as Resale.

You may reproduce the Work:

	- in a printed format or;
	- on a website or;
	- in an electronic document such as a PowerPoint presentation or an ebook or;
	- as part of software you create or;
	- in a video production or;
	- in a music track.

You may use the Work in a work which you are creating for your own purposes or for your client who has asked you to create it.

You may incorporate the Work in a work which is created for Resale by you or your client (provided that only the complete work is offered for sale and the terms of sale (i) require those that acquire the work to only use the Work for their own personal use or in a work they are creating for a client (ii) prohibit resale of the Work as a stand-alone item).

You may display the Work, and make the Work available for use by an unlimited number of your clients, in conjunction with a web site service that you host on behalf of your clients. When using the Work through a web site service, you may make unlimited copies of the Work but you must procure that your clients do not reproduce or use the Work in another application.

If the Work is used or incorporated in a work there is no restriction on the number of copies of that work that can be reproduced and distributed.

For example: you may incorporate the Work, such as a music file, in a sound mixing software program that you or your client distributes commercially. An unlimited number of copies of the software program may be made and sold but the Work cannot be incorporated in more than one software program or other work. Additionally, buyers of the software program must not offer the Work (that is the music file) for sale, such as on a site like AudioJungle.net .

Notwithstanding the restriction on Resale, if you acquire the Work on behalf of your client you may recoup from your client the cost of acquiring the Work.

If the whole, or part, of the Work has been created using materials which are the subject of a GNU General Public License (GPL), your use of the Work (or part Work) is subject to the specific terms of the GPL in place of the foregoing conditions (to the extent the GPL applies).
