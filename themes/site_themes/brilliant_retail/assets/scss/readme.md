## Requirements for Sass

We used Foundation 5.4.7 for this theme. We have included the sass files and folder, but you will need to install it in your system before you can ujse it. Details are here: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html

You can also use an application. Look here for some resources: http://sass-lang.com/install

Below is the Readme from Foundation.

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g bower`

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zurb/foundation-libsass-template.git
npm install && bower install
```

While you're working on your project, run:

 'grunt'

 For production output run:

 'grunt build'

And you're set!
