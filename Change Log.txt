### Version 1.3.1.8
*June 14, 2013*

* IMPORTANT: This version introduces a new method for the forgot password feature. ExpressionEngine 2.6 relies on the 
default member templates for resetting the password. We often discourage using those member templates for security 
reasons and have created tags for handling the reset directly in BrilliantRetail.

* Added br_password_invalid_token language key
* Added br_password_reset_email_invalid language key
