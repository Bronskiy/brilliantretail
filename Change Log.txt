# David Dexter 

* Added cart_has_discount method per Isaac's recommendation. 
* Added br_suppress_new_account_email configuration 
* Added currency_marker variable to checkout_thank tag
* Fixed an issue with custom fields in the BrilliantRetail fieldtype [0000187]
	- 	IMPORTANT: When using custom fields in the BR fieldtype you must namespace
		them with a br: prefix. For example your custom fieldtype name maybe my_field. 
		To display it you must prefix it {br:my_field}. If it is a tag pair be sure to 
		namespace the closing as well. {br:my_field}{internal_tag}{/br:my_field}
* Fixed an issue with category restricted promotions
* Updated new product to automatically set the 'cost' value to '0.00'
* Updated image log message when returning a newly created cached image.
