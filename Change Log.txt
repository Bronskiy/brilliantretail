### IMPORTANT - FedEx shipping module must be reconfigured to work properly. 

* Added product_id to the $amt variable in the _check_product_price method

* Fixed an issue with the FedEx shipping method
* Fixed an issue with Rate Matrix images.
* Removed cron_model.php file
* Removed log_model.php file
